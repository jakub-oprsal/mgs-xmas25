#### University of Birmingham, Tuesday 16 December 2025

The [Midlands Graduate School](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/MGS/) (MGS) is an annual spring graduate school on the mathematical foundations of computing science. It has run annually since 1999 and has been held at either the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, the University of Nottingham, or at the University of Sheffield.

The lectures are aimed at graduate students, typically in their first or second year of study for a PhD, but the school is open to anyone who is interested in learning more about mathematical computing foundations, and all such applicants are warmly welcomed. We very much encourage learners from abroad and from industry to attend, and many have done so in the past.

Participation at the Christmas seminar is free to all, and no registration is required.
