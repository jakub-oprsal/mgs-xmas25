#### University of Birmingham, Tuesday 16 December 2025

The MGS Christmas Seminars 2025 will take place in room LG06 of the [Old Gym](https://campusmap.bham.ac.uk/search/5d6f49221e1f64009327acc1?projectId=uob) at the University of Birmingham, Edgbaston campus, on Tuesday 16 December.
The seminar is co-located with [Types and Topology](https://tdejong.com/mhe60/) on 17--18 December.

The [Midlands Graduate School](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/MGS/) (MGS) is an annual spring graduate school on the mathematical foundations of computing science. It has run annually since 1999 and has been held at either the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, the University of Nottingham, or at the University of Sheffield.

The school is aimed at graduate students, typically in their first or second year of study for a PhD, but the school is open to anyone who is interested in learning more about mathematical computing foundations, and all such applicants are warmly welcomed. We very much encourage learners from abroad and from industry to attend, and many have done so in the past. The next MGS spring school will be held at the University of Nottingham, 13–17 April 2026.

In addition to the spring school, the MGS has an afternoon of Christmas seminars.
Participation at the Christmas seminar is free to all, and no registration is required.
